  aboutMe: `I am an experienced IT technician specialized in systems, networks, and technical support, with professional experience in both educational institutions and international companies. I have strong hands-on skills in hardware assembly and maintenance, system configuration, network management, and technical documentation — including an Erasmus+ internship in Istanbul, Turkey.

I am currently pursuing the Higher Degree in Network Computer Systems Administration (ASIR), where I am deepening my expertise in virtualization, cybersecurity, network services, cloud technologies, and infrastructure management.

I won 1st place in the Cloud Computing category (AWS) at Melilla Skills, standing out in cloud service deployment, automation, and administration. I currently represent Melilla at the SpainSkills national competition.

Proactive, solution-oriented, and a fast learner, I am passionate about continuing to grow in cloud computing, systems administration, and cybersecurity, and I am eager to bring real value to demanding, high-impact tech projects.`,
